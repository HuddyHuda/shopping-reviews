# shopping-reviews

<h1> About this application </h1>

- There are 6 online shopping sites that users/non-user can read about. 

<h1> How to use the application? </h1>

- User can sign up for an account and when they are signed in, they can post their own comments at the site that they
would like to post comments. 

- Non-user can only read the reviews, so if they would like to contribute their comments.. they can sign up for an account.

<h1>How i got the idea? </h1>
- Totally no idea from the beginning so i thought i just ask my TA, kailin. And she said reviews! So that’s where the ideas start coming in... game reviews, restaurant reviews, food reviews, watches reviews, bags reviews, computer reviews, handphone model reviews.. So i thought since i like online shopping.. I  would just do reviews on online shopping sites.

<h1> What are the problems faced </h1>
- I was stuck at trying to display my first data from mongoDB for 3 hours. Even the simplest thing took me so long :( <br/>
- User can edit or delete other user’s comments which they shouldn’t. <br/>
- Trying to make the logo of the shopping site to appear along side with the reviews that is being commented for. <br/>

<h1>Credits</h1>
- Logo usage images for every shopping site is an external url from google which is harded coded inside the json file from the database. <br/>

- Special thanks to kailin, prima, glen for all the assistance that I needed!! :)

<h1> What I want to achieve </h1>
<h5> Can refer to steps-project2.pdf</h5>

- Display all shopping sites with details from the database to the main homepage. <br/>
- Users/non-users can click "read review" button under the respective shopping site thumbnail to go to the shopping site. <br/>
- In every respective shopping site, I want the page to display the details of the shop, when it was established, the website url. Reviews about that shopping site will also be in the same page. Users <b>can write their reviews</b> and <b>edit</b> their own reviews. Non-users <b>can only read</b> other people reviews but <b>not write their own reviews</b> unless they sign up. <br/>
- Every user has a page whereby they can see all the reviews that they have commented for. <br/>
- A search box (that the user can search the shopping site name) and it will list down the comments coming from the shop. - not yet achieved :(
