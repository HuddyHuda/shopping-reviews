# shopping-reviews

<h1> About this application </h1>

- There are 6 online shopping sites that users/non-user can read about. 

<h1> How to use the application? </h1>

- User can sign up for an account and when they are signed in, they can post their own comments at the site that they
would like to post comments. 

- Non-user can only read the reviews, so if they would like to contribute their comments.. they can sign up for an account.

<h1>Credits</h1>
- Logo usage images for every shopping site is an external url from google which is harded coded inside the json file from the database.

- Special thanks to kailin, prima, glen for all the assistance that I needed!! :)

<h1> What I want to achieve </h1>
<h5> Can refer to steps-project2.pdf</h5>

- Display all shopping sites with details from the database to the main homepage. <br/>
- Users/non-users can click "read review" button under the respective shopping site thumbnail to go to the shopping site. <br/>
- In every respective shopping site, I want the page to display the details of the shop, when it was established, the website url. Reviews about that shopping site will also be in the same page. Users <b>can write their reviews</b> and <b>edit</b> their own reviews. Non-users <b>can only read</b> other people reviews but <b>not write their own reviews</b> unless they sign up. <br/>
- Every user has a page whereby they can see all the reviews that they have commented for. <br/>
- A search box (that the user can search the shopping site name) and it will list down the comments coming from the shop. - not yet achieved :(
